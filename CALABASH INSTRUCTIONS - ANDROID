1. Run application to make sure everything is good
2. Run calabash-android gen in app file to create features folder
3. Generate APK
4. Run tests: calabash-android run <path-to-apk> (May have to set ANDROID_HOME variable to sdk path:

* When writing custom steps: use query to find things in the app: 
https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/testcloud/calabash/calabash-query-syntax/ 
You want to enter console to use query: calabash-android console <path-to-apk> 

** If query is being weird, make sure your ANDRIOD_HOME variable is set properly.
